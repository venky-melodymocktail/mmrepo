## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin that compiles HTML (hast) to
any JSX runtime (preact, react, solid, svelte, vue, etc).

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**rehype** adds support for HTML to unified.
**hast** is the HTML AST that rehype uses.
This is a rehype plugin that adds a compiler to compile hast to a JSX runtime.

## When should I use this?

This plugin adds a compiler for rehype, which means that it turns the final
HTML (hast) syntax tree into something else (in this case, a `JSX.Element`).
Itâ€™s useful when youâ€™re already using unified (whether remark or rehype) or are
open to learning about ASTs (theyâ€™re powerful!) and want to render content in
your app.

If youâ€™re not familiar with unified, then [`react-markdown`][react-markdown]
might be a better fit.
You can also use [`react-remark`][react-remark] instead, which is somewhere
between `rehype-react` and `react-markdown`, as it does more that the former and
is more modern (such as supporting hooks) than the latter, and also a good
alternative.
If you want to use JavaScript and JSX *inside* markdown files, use [MDX][].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-react
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeReact from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-react@8'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeReact from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-react@8?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our React app `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {Fragment, createElement, useEffect, useState} from 'react'
import * as prod from 'react/jsx-runtime'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeReact from 'rehype-react'
import {unified} from 'unified'

// @ts-expect-error: the react types are missing.
const production = {Fragment: prod.Fragment, jsx: prod.jsx, jsxs: prod.jsxs}

const text = `<h2>Hello, world!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page ðŸ‘€</p>`

/**
 * @param {string} text
 * @returns {JSX.Element}
 */
function useProcessor(text) {
  const [Content, setContent] = useState(createElement(Fragment))

  useEffect(
    function () {
      ;(async function () {
        const file = await unified()
          .use(rehypeParse, {fragment: true})
          .use(rehypeReact, production)
          .process(text)

        setContent(file.result)
      })()
    },
    [text]
  )

  return Content
}

export default function App() {
  return useProcessor(text)
}
```

â€¦running that in Next.js or similar, weâ€™d get:

```html
<h2>Hello, world!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page ðŸ‘€</p>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`rehypeReact`][api-rehype-react].

### `unified().use(rehypeReact, options)`

Turn HTML into preact, react, solid, svelte, vue, etc.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], required)
    â€” configuration

###### Returns

Nothing (`undefined`).

###### Result

This plugin registers a compiler that returns a `JSX.Element` where compilers
typically return `string`.
When using `.stringify` on `unified`, the result is such a `JSX.Element`.
When using `.process` (or `.processSync`), the result is available at
`file.result`.

###### Frameworks

There are differences between what JSX frameworks accept, such as whether they
accept `class` or `className`, or `background-color` or `backgroundColor`.

For hast elements transformed by this project, this is be handled through
options:

| Framework | `elementAttributeNameCase` | `stylePropertyNameCase` |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Preact    | `'html'`                   | `'dom'`                 |
| React     | `'react'`                  | `'dom'`                 |
| Solid     | `'html'`                   | `'css'`                 |
| Vue       | `'html'`                   | `'dom'`                 |

### `Components`

Possible components to use (TypeScript type).

See [`Components` from
`hast-util-to-jsx-runtime`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-jsx-runtime#components)
for more info.

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `Fragment` ([`Fragment` from
    `hast-util-to-jsx-runtime`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-jsx-runtime#fragment),
    required)
    â€” fragment
*   `jsx` ([`Jsx` from
    `hast-util-to-jsx-runtime`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-jsx-runtime#jsx),
    required in production)
    â€” dynamic JSX
*   `jsxs` ([`Jsx` from
    `hast-util-to-jsx-runtime`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-jsx-runtime#jsx),
    required in production)
    â€” static JSX
*   `jsxDEV` ([`JsxDev` from
    `hast-util-to-jsx-runtime`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-jsx-runtime#jsxdev),
    required in development)
    â€” development JSX
*   `components` ([`Partial<Components>`][api-components], optional)
    â€” components to use
*   `development` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    â€” whether to use `jsxDEV` when on or `jsx` and `jsxs` when off
*   `elementAttributeNameCase` (`'html'` or `'react'`, default: `'react'`)
    â€” specify casing to use for attribute names
*   `passNode` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    â€” pass the hast element node to components
*   `space` (`'html'` or `'svg'`, default: `'html'`)
    â€” whether `tree` is in the `'html'` or `'svg'` space, when an `<svg>`
    element is found in the HTML space, this package already automatically
    switches to and from the SVG space when entering and exiting it
*   `stylePropertyNameCase`
    (`'css'` or `'dom'`, default: `'dom'`)
    â€” specify casing to use for property names in `style` objects
*   `tableCellAlignToStyle`
    (`boolean`, default: `true`)
    â€” turn obsolete `align` props on `td` and `th` into CSS `style` props

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types [`Components`][api-components] and
[`Options`][api-options].
More advanced types are exposed from
[`hast-util-to-jsx-runtime`][hast-util-to-jsx-runtime].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `rehype-react@^8`,
compatible with Node.js 17.

This plugin works with `rehype-parse` version 3+, `rehype` version 4+, and
`unified` version 9+, and React 18+.

## Security

Use of `rehype-react` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack if the tree is unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
